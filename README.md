### This repo documents my EKS & AKS journey

#### What inspired this repo 

How many of you can attest that you fully know kubernetes.? Only a few. Kubernetes is easy to forget. You need to keep working on it. I discovered that I would work on microservices project for a period of say 2 months only to forget 6 month later. 

I decided to document so that I can use this as reference whenever I am involved with any kubernetes project.


I have worked on both AKS and EKS in the past.


My end-goal is "I want to reliably self-host services", and not "I want to fully understand a complex, scalable, and highly sophisticated container orchestrator" With that in mind

#### I have broken down this repo into 4 subfolders folders

##### EKS Platform
- Contains terraform code to deploy EKS infrastructure on AWS.
##### EKS Applications
- Contains different microservice applications in C#, Java springboot, node & Python
##### AKS Platform
- Contains terraform code to deploy EKS infrastructure on Azure.

Excited to share insights into my latest project leveraging Terraform to automate the provisioning of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster! üåêüí°
In this project, I focused on automating the deployment of various resources to support the AKS cluster enhancing security and isolating network resources using a Service Principal. The deployment unfolded in the following key steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Network Creation: A secure space for hosting the AKS cluster, ensuring isolation from other network resources.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Container Registry: Ensuring secure and private container image management.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Key Vault: A centralized vault to securely store sensitive information like client secrets.
4Ô∏è‚É£ AKS Cluster Setup: Configuration of nodes for running containerized applications, with specifications defined using Terraform for automatic scaling and adaptability.

Excited to hear your thoughts and feedback on this journey! Let's continue pushing the boundaries of automation and secure cloud deployments. üíªüåê
Feel free to customize it further to match your personal style and preferences!


##### AKS Applications
- Contains different microservice applications in C#, Java springboot, node & Python


#### For both EKS and AKS, you need 2 things:

    - A cluster
    - A way to deploy workloads into the cluster
